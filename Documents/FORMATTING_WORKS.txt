# Quick Guide: Format Your Quiz Questions

## ✅ The Feature is Working!
Question 2 shows formatted because it already has backticks in the database.

## To Format Other Questions:

### Format the question text like this:

**Instead of:**
```
What will this code print? print("Score:", 10)
```

**Use this format:**
```
What will this code print?

```python
print("Score:", 10)
```
(close with three backticks)
```

### How to Update in Database:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database
2. Update the `question_text` field in `quiz.questions` table
3. Wrap code sections with triple backticks

### Example SQL Update:
```sql
UPDATE quiz.questions
SET question_text = 'What will this code print?

```python
print("Score:", 10)
```'
WHERE question_id = 'your-question-id-here';
```

## 🎯 The formatting works automatically when you use:
- Triple backticks (```) for code blocks
- Single backticks (`) for inline code like `print()` or `input()`

Your implementation is complete and working!
